# IDS using Regex + DFA

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that scans packet payloads for suspicious patterns using **Regular Expressions** and **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)** conversion.  
This hybrid approach helps detect worms, exploits, and malicious payloads that may bypass simple regex checks.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Regex Matching** â€” Fast and flexible pattern scanning
- **DFA Matching** â€” Converts regex to deterministic finite automata for state-based detection
- **Dual Mode** â€” Runs both methods and flags high-confidence threats
- **ANN Integration** â€” Uses an Artificial Neural Network trained on the NSL-KDD dataset for anomaly detection
- **Streamlit Dashboard** â€” User-friendly UI with visual detection results and explanations
- **Packet Capture Demo** â€” Capture live packets and scan in real time (requires privileges)
